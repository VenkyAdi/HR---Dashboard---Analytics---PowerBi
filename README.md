The initial dataset comprises a CSV file containing 38 columns and around 1.5k rows. It encapsulates diverse details concerning employee demographics, job roles, salaries, and tenure.

**Data Cleaning and Processing:**
Several preparatory steps were executed on the dataset. Null values and duplicates were removed, spelling errors rectified, and appropriate data types assigned. Additionally, a conditional column was introduced to denote attrition, with values of 1 for 'yes' and 0 for 'no' based on the attrition column. Moreover, a new measure was formulated to compute the attrition rate, derived by dividing the total attrition count by the overall employee count.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
Key performance indicators (KPIs) were delineated to monitor and analyze employee performance and attrition. Card visualizations in Power BI were utilized for the following KPIs:

1. Employee count
2. Attrition
3. Average income
4. Average tenure

**Charts and Insights:**
Various charts and visualizations were utilized to derive insights from the employee data:

- **Donut Chart:** Illustrated the dominance of gender count between male and female employees.
  
- **Clustered Bar Chart:** Unveiled the average income across different job roles, providing a comparative view of income levels.

- **Matrix Table:** Displayed job roles alongside corresponding job satisfaction scores, highlighting significant attrition in roles such as laboratory technicians, sales executives, and research scientists.

- **Area Chart:** Presented attrition count over years of employment, showcasing peaks after the first year, 5 years, and 10 years.

- **Stacked Column Chart:** Demonstrated attrition based on age distribution, with a secondary chart delineating attrition by educational background.

**Filters:**
Department filters were implemented to allow dashboard users to filter data by specific departments.
